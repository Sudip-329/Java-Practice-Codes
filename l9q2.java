/*Write a program in java to create a class Bank having ROI (Rate of Interest) data
member and find_ROI() member function. Derive two classes HDFC, ICICI with find_ROI()
function. The ROI of HDFC bank is calculated as ROI = (Last year annual profit / 1.5
crore) where the annual profit is an user entered value. The ROI of ICICI bank is 
calculated as ROI = Fund supported by RBI in crore / 1.5 Crore where Fund supported
by RBI is an user entered value. So find the rate of interest of all the Banks 
using dynamic method dispatchÂ technique.*/
